# Live_Project
## Tech Academy Live Project Details
After completing the Tech Academy courses I was given the opportunity to work in a development team setting with my fellow students and Tech
Academy instructors. We worked on a full scale MVC code-first project furthering the development of an interface to track student applications
and job offers for better front-end experience as well as tracking more data for the Academy to use for future students.

Below is a quick description of the different stories I completed during my time on the live project. Accompanying code and images have been 
uploaded as well.
